# clubwho.net

clubwho.net used to redirect to my personal website (ewanlyon.com). I then wanted clubwho.com but apparently it's worth $9567 and was gonna cost $8999 to buy.

Obviously it's for someone who makes a bar/restaurant called "Club Who" but I am going to do my darnest to make sure I CLUBWHO stays at the top of search results for Clubwho.

It's just a glorified linktree (I cannot believe linktree makes that much money)
